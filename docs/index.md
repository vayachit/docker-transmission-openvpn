## Quick Start

This container contains OpenVPN and Transmission with a configuration where Transmission is running only when OpenVPN has an active tunnel. It bundles configuration files for many popular VPN providers to make the setup easier.

You need to specify your provider and credentials with environment variables, as well as mounting volumes where the data should be stored. An example run command to get you going is provided below.

It also bundles an installation of Tinyproxy to also be able to proxy web traffic over your VPN, as well as scripts for opening a port for Transmission if you are using PIA or Perfect Privacy providers.

```
$ docker run --cap-add=NET_ADMIN -d \
              -v /your/storage/path/:/downloads \
              -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
              -e CREATE_TUN_DEVICE=true \
              -e OPENVPN_PROVIDER=PIA \
              -e OPENVPN_CONFIG=CA\ Toronto \
              -e OPENVPN_USERNAME=user \
              -e OPENVPN_PASSWORD=pass \
              -e WEBPROXY_ENABLED=false \
              -e LOCAL_NETWORK=192.168.0.0/16 \
              --log-driver json-file \
              --log-opt max-size=10m \
              -p 9091:9091 \

## Please help out (about:maintenance)

This image was created for my own use, but sharing is caring, so it had to be open source.
It has now gotten quite popular, and that's great! But keeping it up to date, providing support, fixes
and new features takes a lot of time.

I'm therefore kindly asking you to donate if you feel like you're getting a good tool
and you're able to spare some dollars to keep it functioning as it should. There's a couple of ways to do it:

Become a patron, supporting the project with a small monthly amount.
